        <br>
        <p>I went to school at Lane Community College in Eugene, OR. I studied computer science. I worked as an intern contributing to large project with about ten other team members.
            After that, I came to Bend, OR and worked mainly as an administrative assistant for a company in Prinville, OR. My goals right now are to complete Code Fellows courses and
            complete my Apprenticeship.
